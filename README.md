# Little Free Library

A little free library inventory app in Sinatra/Padrino.

## Statement of Ambitions

- check-in/check-out events (so we can tell if a title comes back
  through)
- pleasant mobile interface (so librarian can inventory books, add books
  from a phone)
- book tracking (through a simple code for each book, generated when a
  book is added to the inventory)
- RSS/Atom of current inventory
